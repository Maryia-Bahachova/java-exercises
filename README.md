# Order Processor Lab

## Task Description

The goal of this lab was to implement an **Order Processor** system in Java.  
The system should handle:

- Customer orders
- Product management
- Discount application
- Payment processing
- Logging of orders

The main idea was to practice **object-oriented programming** in Java, including classes, methods, packages, and basic design patterns.

## Implementation

The project includes several packages:

- `customerservice` – handles customer-related classes and services
- `discount` – contains classes for applying discounts to orders
- `order` – core order processing logic
- `payment` – classes for payment handling
- `test` – unit tests for the main functionality

### Key Features

- Modular structure using Java packages
- Classes for different responsibilities (OrderProcessor, PaymentService, DiscountService, etc.)
- Logging and handling of orders
- Unit tests for verification

## Result

After completing this lab:

- The Order Processor system is implemented according to the requirements
- All core functionalities are working
- The code is organized into logical packages
- Unit tests verify main functionalities

## Notes

- Each folder represents a Java package  
- The structure allows easy extension and maintenance
- Demonstrates understanding of OOP principles, package organization, and basic design patterns
- The file `OrderProcessor.java` is the **original source file** for the lab
