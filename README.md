# Order Processor Lab

## Task Description

The goal was to improve the code structure, readability, and maintainability while keeping the core functionality intact.

## Notes

- Each folder represents a Java package  
- Demonstrates understanding of OOP principles, package organization, and design best practices  
- `OrderProcessor.java` is the **original source file** that was refactored

## Implementation

The project includes several packages:

- `customerservice` – handles customer-related classes and services
- `discount` – contains classes for applying discounts to orders
- `order` – core order processing logic
- `payment` – classes for payment handling
- `test` – unit tests for the main functionality

### Key Features

- Refactored `OrderProcessor.java` for clarity and maintainability  
- Modular structure using Java packages  
- Classes for different responsibilities (PaymentService, DiscountService, etc.)  
- Logging and handling of orders  
- Unit tests for verification

## Result

After completing this lab:

- The Order Processor system is refactored according to **clean code** and **SOLID** principles  
- All core functionalities are preserved and tested  
- The code is organized into logical packages for easy extension and maintenance
